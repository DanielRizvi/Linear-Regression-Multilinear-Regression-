Linear Regression &amp; Multilinear Regression Analysis of Advertising Data 

Overview: This Jupyter notebook contains a detailed analysis of advertising data, using linear regression to model the relationship between different advertising media (TV, radio, newspaper) and sales. The notebook demonstrates how to build and evaluate a linear regression and multilinear regression model using Python, and includes step-by-step instructions, code examples, and visualizations.

Data: The data used in this project is taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv

Methodology: The notebook uses the Statsmodels and Scikit-learn Python libraries to perform a multiple linear regression analysis, with sales as the dependent variable and TV, radio, and newspaper as the independent variables. The notebook includes code examples for data visualization, data preprocessing, model building, and model evaluation, using techniques such as scatter plots, correlation matrices, residual plots, and R-squared statistics.

Results: The notebook presents the results of the linear regression and multilinear regression analysis, including the estimated regression coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals for each variable, as well as the overall goodness-of-fit of the model. The notebook also includes visualizations of the model predictions, residual plots, and other diagnostic plots, to help interpret the results.

Conclusion: The notebook concludes with a summary of the main findings and insights from the linear & multilinear regression analysis.
